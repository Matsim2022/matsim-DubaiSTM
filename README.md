#An Agent-Based Strategic Transport Model for Dubai

This research and experimental initiative aims to develop a strategic transport model based on an agent- and activity-based modeling framework tailored to Dubaiâ€™s dynamic urban context. The model is being developed entirely using publicly available data and AI-generated datasets to explore the feasibility and benefits of this advanced approach. The primary goal is to evaluate how such a model can enhance transport planning and analysis compared to traditional survey-based data methods.
